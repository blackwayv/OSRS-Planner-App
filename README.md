###Old School RuneScape Account Planner###
Installation:
git clone https://github.com/blackwayv/mvp.git

Starting:
First, install dependencies so the program can run:
npm install

Then, you will need to use run scripts to prepare the files:
npm run react-dev

Finally, you are ready to start the website!
npm start

Usage:
Currently the program uses localstorage to store all data. Once this has become a website, I can run
a PostgreSQL database on the instance to keep all the data in cloud storage so it stays persistant.
Some features are not complete yet. Once I am out of school, this will be my side project.
