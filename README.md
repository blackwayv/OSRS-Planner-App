# Old School RuneScape Account Planner

This app is meant to help Old School Runescape players track their progress properly, and create quick and efficient ways to customize a good to-do list. It will feature quest point, quests, and skill requirements/recommendations from the wiki, as well as a link to quests and skill guides. Old School RuneScape Account Planner pulls your skills fresh from the OSRS HiScores

### Installation
In your bash terminal, copy and pase this to clone the repository:

`
git clone https://github.com/blackwayv/mvp.git
`

### Starting:

First, install dependencies so the program can run:

`
npm install
`

Then, you will need to use run scripts to prepare the files:

`
npm run react-dev
`

Finally, you are ready to start the website!

`
npm start
`

### Usage:

Currently the program uses localstorage to store all data. Once this has become a website, I can run
a PostgreSQL database on the instance to keep all the data in cloud storage so it stays persistant.
Some features are not complete yet. Once I am out of school, this will be my side project.
